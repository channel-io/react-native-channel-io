## ChannelIO

#Channel io SDK LICENSE

This is an agreement between you and ZOYI Corporation (“ZOYI”), a Korean corporation
located at 15th Floor, 141 Teheran-ro, Gangnam-gu (KR Tower), Seoul, Korea, regarding 
your use of the SDK and any associated documentation or other materials for Channel Desk
as made available by ZOYI (collectively, the "SDK"). This agreement applies to any 
updates or supplements for the SDK, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, 
those other terms apply.

By installing, accessing or otherwise using the SDK, you accept the terms of this 
agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this agreement, do not install, 
access or use the SDK.

If you agree to comply with this agreement, you have the rights below.
(1) USE OF THE SDK. Subject to your compliance with this agreement, ZOYI hereby 
authorizes you to use the SDK solely for the purpose of creating mobile applications 
designed to operate with Channel Desk (referred to as "Authorized Applications"). 
You may not rent, lease or lend any of your rights in the SDK or access to Channel 
Desk. You may make a reasonable number of copies of the SDK for the purposes set 
forth herein, provided that you reproduce only complete copies, including without 
limitation all "read me" files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and 
terms that ZOYI has included in the SDK.

(2) SCOPE OF LICENSE. The SDK is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives 
you some rights to use the SDK. ZOYI specifically does not grant any express or 
implied rights under its copyright, patents or other intellectual property with 
respect to your Authorized Applications. In doing so, you must comply with any 
technical limitations in the SDK that only allow you to use it in certain ways. 
You may not: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, distribute or disassemble the SDK, 
except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits; or (b) make 
more copies of the SDK than specified in this agreement, except and only to the 
extent applicable law expressly permits; or (c) publish the SDK for others to 
copy; or (d) rent, lease or lend the SDK.

(3) USE OF THE SERVICES. Your use of Channel Desk, and the use of Channel Desk 
by anyone hosting or using your Authorized Application, is governed by the 
then-current Terms of Services (“TOS”) for Channel Desk which can be found 
at: [http://channel.io/en/terms]. 

(4) FEEDBACK. By submitting feedback to ZOYI, either via email at [feedback@channel.io]
 or by any other means: you automatically grant to ZOYI a perpetual, irrevocable, 
transferable, royalty-free license to use your feedback for any and all purposes 
without any compensation to you.

(5) TERMINATION. ZOYI reserves the right to discontinue offering the SDK or 
Channel Desk or to modify the SDK or Channel Desk at any time in its sole discretion. 
This Section and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 will survive termination 
of this agreement or any discontinuation of the offering of the SDK or Channel 
Desk along with any other provisions that would reasonably be deemed to survive 
such events.

(6) RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. You are not authorized to alter, modify, copy, edit, 
format, create derivative works of or otherwise use any materials, content or 
technology provided under this agreement except as explicitly provided in this 
agreement or approved in advance in writing by ZOYI.

(7) MODIFICATIONS; NOTICES. If we change this contract, then we will give you 
notice before the change is in force. If you do not agree to these changes, 
then you must cancel and stop using the SDK and Channel Desk before the changes 
are in force. If you do not stop using the SDK or Channel Desk, then your 
use of the SDK or Channel Desk will continue under the changed contract. ZOYI 
may give notices to you, at ZOYI's option, by posting on any portion of [ZOYI.co] 
or by electronic mail to any e-mail address provided by you to ZOYI.

(8) ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any applicable TOS or contract for 
Channel Desk, are the entire agreement with respect to the SDK or Channel Desk.

(9) APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE. Korean law governs the interpretation of this 
agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of 
laws principles. You agree that any action brought under this agreement will 
be subject to exclusive jurisdiction of the Seoul Central District Court.

(10) DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The SDK is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk 
of using it. ZOYI gives no express or implied warranties, guarantees or conditions. 
You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this 
agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, ZOYI 
excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular 
purpose and non-infringement. ZOYI does not represent or warrant that the SDK 
or Channel Desk will always be available, uninterrupted, secure, or error free.

(11) LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You acknowledge that 
you cannot recover any damages in relation to this agreement, including consequential, 
lost profits, special, direct, indirect or incidental damages. This limitation 
applies to:

a. anything related to the SDK, services, or content (including code) on third 
party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

b. claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, 
strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
